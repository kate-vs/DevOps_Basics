# Creating a GitHub Repository
A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded. This GitHub repository acts as your remote repository. So let me make your task easy, just follow these simple steps to create a GitHub repository:  

* Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github”.  
* Click on “Start a new project”.  

Refer to the below screenshot to get a better understanding.

* Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. You can also give a description to your repository (optional).

Now, if you noticed by default a GitHub repository is public which means that anyone can view the contents of this repository whereas in a private repository, you can choose who can view the content. Also, private repository is a paid version. Also, if you refer the above screenshot, initialize the repository with a README file. This file contains the description of the file and once you check this box, this will be the first file inside your repository.  

Congratulations, your repository is successfully created! It will look like the below screenshot:

So now my central repository has been sucessfully created! Once this is done, you are ready to commit, pull, push and perform all the other operations.
