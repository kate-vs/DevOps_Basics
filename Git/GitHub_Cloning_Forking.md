# Cloning and Forking GitHub Repository
### Cloning
Before I actually talk about cloning a GitHub repository, first let us understand why do we need to clone a repository. The answer is simple! Suppose you want to use some code which is present in a public repository, you can directly copy the contents by cloning or downloading.  

Refer to the below screenshot for a better understanding.

### Forking
First, let us talk about why do we need forking. Suppose, you need some code which is present in a public repository, under your repository and GitHub account. For this, we need to fork a repository.  

Before we get started with forking, there are some important points which you should always keep in mind.  
* Changes done to the original repository will be reflected back to the forked repository.  
* If you make a change in forked repository, it will not b reflected to the original repository until and unless you have made a pull request.  

Now let’s see how can you want to fork a repository. For that, follow the below steps:
* Go to Explore and search for public repositories.
* Click “fork”. Note that this “tangent” repository is already forked 27 times and it is under “google” account.  

Refer the below image for better understanding.

As soon as you click on “Fork”, it will take some time to fork the repository. Once done you will notice that the repository name is under your account.  

For reference, you can have a look at the below screenshot.

Congratulations! You have successfully forked an existing repository under your own account.
